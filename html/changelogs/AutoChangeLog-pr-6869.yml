changes:
  - tweak: Removed Jester and Warrior causing natural maintenance to crew area migrations
      due to problems with implementation.
  - balance: Burrow migrations will trigger one minute more often. Migrations now
      only take twenty seconds now as well, beware maintenance burrows from now on
      as there may be little warning.
  - balance: The Warrior will now be more aggressive in spawning more moderately severe
      events than before, such as infestation events. Blitzshell and Serbians have
      also been weighted to be somewhat more common than other antagonist choices
      with this storyteller.
