changes:
  - balance: doubled the maximum amount of walls bullets are able to pierce and piercing
      a wall no longer makes the bullet lose AP.
  - balance: made AMR ammo from the uplink cheaper and increased the damage of the
      Breacher shells
  - balance: tripled the penetration power of the AMR
  - balance: using a scope makes shots more accurate now
  - tweak: the talking spider and the control spiders will no longer be triggered
      when activating all carrion spiders.
