  - rscadd: Exclusively added a lever shotgun with high damage low AP, and a relatively
      low ammo high power .40 lever rifle to marshal's uplink, both of which can be
      sawn off for weaker but smaller guns that fit in holsters
  - imageadd: Winchester and lever shotgun and their sawn-off variants
