      to who made it, so that everyone can have a red military beret.
  - tweak: swapped the names of the assistant formal uniform and tuxedo, as the assistant
      formal uniform looks like an actual tuxedo more than the "tuxedo" and made it

      suit" now

      the jackets 2 is kind of stupid considering there's other jackets with 1 with
      the exact same stats, ie the punk ones.
  - tweak: put the triad jacket into the contraband section of the style vendor to
      slightly dampen it's usage (and because it's kind of funny).
