changes:
  - refactor: recoil within guns refactored
  - refactor: bullets determine base recoil
  - tweak: you can now wield every gun to reduce recoil, including pistols. Bracing
      also reduces recoil. The reduction of both scales with gun size
  - bugfix: roaches no longer suffer from recoil
  - balance: recoil was tweaked to feel closer to the october values, giving FA a
      slight underhand
