changes:
  - balance: tables and low walls protect the leg instead of having a random chance
      to eat bullets
  - refactor: refactored the targeting check of bullets that updates the targeted
      limb when hitting a mob
  - balance: resting now doesn't force you to drop items
  - balance: you can manage your inventory while resting, but not use them to interact
      with the world
